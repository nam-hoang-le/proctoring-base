# Proctoring Base

## Overview: 

This is the repository solutions for challenge from George Washington Institute for Data Science & AI.

The challenge requires me to prove skills in creating functions/models for AI Proctoring systems. 

AI Proctoring, in simple understanding, is a system using AI techniques to support managing the online examination to ensure that participants do the examination with permitted behaviors. 


## Analysis:
From the challenge, I created different functions corresponding with detailed documents containing the problem and solutions for each of them: 

1. [Eye Blinking](docs/eyeBlinking/eyeBlinking.md)
2. [Eye Gazing](docs/eyeGazing/eyeGazing.md)
3. [Mouth Opening](docs/mouthOpening/mouthOpening.md)
4. [Head Pose](docs/headPoseEstimation/headPoseEstimation.md)
5. [Optical Character Recognition](docs/opticalCharacterRecognition/opticalCharacterRecognition.md)
6. [Mask Detector](docs/maskDetector/maskDetector.md)
7. [Spoofing Detection](docs/spoofingDetection/spoofingDetection.md)



## Installation
1. Install important packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
2. Run every functions: 
- For Eye Blinking:
```
cd eyeBlinking 
python main.py
```
- For Eye Gazing:
```
cd eyeGazing 
python mainHor.py
python mainVer.py
```
- For Head Pose Estimation:
```
cd headPoseEstimation 
python main.py
```
- For Mask Detector:
```

```
- For Mouth Opening:
```
cd mouthOpening 
python main.py
```
- For Spoofing Detection: 
```
cd spoofingDetection 
python main.py
```
